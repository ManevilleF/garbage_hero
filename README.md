Use `cargo run --release` to run the game natively.

For debug options you can enable the following features:
* `debug` to enable the debug gizmo and UI
* `debug_physics` to enable the avian3d debug rendered
* `debug_world` to enable the World inspector plugin

## Assets

All assets in the `assets/` folder have their associated licenses.
